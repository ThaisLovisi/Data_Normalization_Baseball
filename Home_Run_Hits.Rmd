## Introduction

Normalized data organizes data focused on reduce the redundancy and ensure data integrity.  During normalization, the structure minimizes duplicate information to avoid data redundancy and inconsistencies.  Removing redundancy and inconsistencies improves data integrity, reduces storage, and simplifies database management. It also allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation through querying and reporting. 

Normalization obeys a group of rules called normal forms. Normal forms of data are: 1) reduces data redundancy and 2) improves data integrity. Therefore, a normalized table:

1) Does not have Data Redundancy: data is not duplicated or repeated. 

2) Well-Defined Primary Key: the primary key uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key is as a reference for relationships with other tables.

3) Atomic Values: each column in a normalized table contains atomic (indivisible) values. Each column holds only one value, and there are no repeating groups or arrays within a column.

4) No Partial Dependencies: each non-primary key column is dependent on the primary key. In other words, all the columns in the table correlate to the primary key as a whole and not just part of it.

5) No Transitive Dependencies: does not have a column that depends on another column linked to a third column. Column's relationship must be direct with the primary key and not mediated through other columns.

The following project has as its main goal design a normalized SQL schema from a external database in R. 

##  Covering All Bases: Essential General Information about the Data

We will work with data on Major League Baseball game statistics, compiled by Retrosheet. This dataset contains data from the year range of 1800s untill 2000s. 

The defensive positions identification code are :<br>
1.    Pitcher<br>
2.    Catcher <br>
3.    First baseman <br>
4.    Second baseman<br>
5.    Third baseman<br>
6.    Shortstop <br>
7.    Left fielder<br> 
8.    Center fielder<br> 
9.    Right fielder<br> 

We gonna work with game_log.csv as our main table and other three auxiliaries tables:
<br>* park_codes.csv
<br>* person_codes.csv
<br>* team_codes.csv

And file game_log_fields.txt, where we can find detailed information about game_log.csv.

### Setting the Stage for Analyzing Baseball Data!

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
#Running packages
packages <- c('tidyverse',
             'ggplot2',
             'data.table',
             'RSQLite',
             'DBI',
             'kableExtra')

options(rgl.debug = TRUE)

if(sum(as.numeric(!packages %in% installed.packages())) != 0){
  instalador <- packages[!packages %in% installed.packages()]
  for(i in 1:length(instalador)) {
    install.packages(instalador, dependencies = T)
    break()}

```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Loading tables just for overview
tables_to_be_load <- c('game_log.csv', 'park_codes.csv', 'person_codes.csv', 'team_codes.csv')
sapply(tables_to_be_load, read.csv)

```

<br> The next step is to read and store the files at objects. For ´game_log.csv´ is needed to change and specify column types for the data using the col_types argument. In this case it will be needed for all columns be set to "c", which represents character/string type.

```{r}
park_codes <-  read.csv('park_codes.csv')
person_codes <- read.csv('person_codes.csv')
team_codes <- read.csv('team_codes.csv')
game_log <- read_csv("game_log.csv", 
                col_types = cols(.default = "c",
                                 v_league = "c", h_league = "c",
                                 `3b_umpire_id` = "c", `3b_umpire_name` = "c",

                                 `lf_umpire_id` = "c", `lf_umpire_name` = "c",
                                 `rf_umpire_id` = "c", `rf_umpire_name` = "c",
                                 completion = "c", winning_rbi_batter_id = "c",
                                 winning_rbi_batter_id_name = "c", protest = "c",
                                 v_first_catcher_interference = "c", 
                                 h_first_catcher_interference = "c"))#Specifies column type argument for each listed column

# For import data is also needed have a version of game_log with the original vars

game_log_original <- read.csv("game_log.csv")
```

### Scouting the Field: An Overview of game_log.csv

```
```{r}
# How are defensive positions coded?
unique(game_log$h_player_1_def_pos)
```
<br>The `game_log` is a very robust dataset with 161 variables and 171,907 observations with details about game's date, number of games, place, team, score, etc. The defensive positions are coded from 1-10. Yet, is not clear what means 10. All stored variables are in character format and contain at least one NA input.

<br>Also at this stage is not possible identify our primary key for this dataset.

```

<br>This file contains 20494 rows and 7 columns. With all 7 variables listed as character type. The table “person_codes” tells you details about each player. The primary key of this table is id. 
<br> The 'id' is connected to the game_log table with variables that use player’s id as input.

# Display the column info using a kable table
kable(column_info4, caption = "Column Information Table") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

The team_codes table provides information about each team. Its primary key is team_id. This table is connected to the park_codes and game_log tables with “team_id” variable. The foreign key in game_log tables are v_name, v_league, h_name, h_league. This file contains 150 rows and 8 columns. With variable 8 listed as integer type. 

## Going Beyond the Box Score: Exploring Additional Information

<br>**game_log** : has a record of over 170,000 games, chronologically ordered, that occur between 1871 and 2016.
<br>For each game we have:
* general information on the game
* team level stats for each team
* a list of players from each team, numbered, with their defensive positions
* the umpires that officiated the game
* some 'awards', like winning and losing pitcher

<br>**person_code** : is a list of people related to the team with IDs. The IDs look like a match to those used in the game_log. There are debut dates for: players, managers, coaches and umpires.  With some people been one or more of these roles, or more than one person with same name (not sure yet).

<br>Coaches and managers are two different things in baseball. And seems like coaches aren't recorded in the game log.
<br>**park_codes** : list of all baseball parks with IDs which match with the game_log, as well as names, nicknames, city and league.
<br>**team_codes** : list of all teams, with team_ids which seem to match the game_log.

# Importing Data into SQLite

```{r}
 dataset_creation <- "C:/Users/lovis/OneDrive/Documents/MBA/New folder/SQL_PROJ/SQL_proj_3_Baseball/new_Baseball.db"

# Connect to SQLite
conn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "new_Baseball.db", create = TRUE)
        
# Write table for each dataset
        dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "game_log", 
              value = game_log_original, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)
        
        dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "person_codes", 
            value = person_codes, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)
        
        dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "team_codes", 
             value = team_codes, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)
        
        dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "park_codes", 
             value = park_codes, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)


# List of tables that were connected
dbListTables(conn)

```

```{r}
dbDisconnect(conn)

## Swing for Success: Data Normalization

<br>Within a normalized table, every column should be related, or be an attribute, to the primary key. Any columns that are not an attribute to the primary key are better placed in their own tables. 
 <br> In a normalized table, **non-primary** key columns should be attributes of the primary key. We also want to **eliminate repetition of data across tables**. So, any redundant data is available elsewhere.
 
### Step 1. Correlating Key Metrics through Data Tables

*game_log and park_code share the same data for park_id, 
*game_log and team_codes share team_id that is the same as v_code
*game_log column data is related to :
<br>person_codes by column debut_dates
<br>team_codes by columns start, end and sequence
<br>park_codes by columns start and end years
* In game_log, all offensive and defensive stats are repeated for the home team and the visiting team. 
* At game_log, we have a listing for 9 players on each team with their positions. Those inputs can generate a new table that tracks player appearances and positions.
* We have several awards in game_log like winning pitcher and losing pitcher. 

<br> However, while all other tables have a unique id, the there is no unique id for each game in the game_log table. It will be needed to create an primary key for this table with the unique ID's.

<br>According to the  Retrosheet guidelines the requirements to write the game_id are:

      *Game ids must have 12 characters
      *First three: home team name (format: ABC) 
      * Next eight: year,month, day ( format: yyyymmdd) 
      * Last digit: + 0 if single game, + 1 if first game, + 2 if second game.

So, the game id will be a string concatenation, that has a unique ID, of h_name, number_of_game.

```{r}

#Creating a new column to the table with no data
conn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname = "new_Baseball.db")

c_added <- 'ALTER TABLE game_log
            ADD COLUMN game_id CHARACTER;'
            
dbExecute(conn, c_added)


# game_id creation
concatenate_str <- 'UPDATE game_log
                    SET game_id = date || h_name || number_of_game
                    WHERE game_id IS NULL '
dbExecute(conn,concatenate_str)


#Just for be sure lets check the query

qury <- 'SELECT game_id,
      date,
      h_name,
      number_of_game
  FROM game_log
  LIMIT 5;'

dbGetQuery(conn,qury)
```
#### It works &#10083;</p>

### A QUICK REMINDER TO MY FUTURE SELF
Dear me, the {r adding_col, engine = 'sql'} is a code chunk header syntax used in R Markdown, which specifies the language (in this case, R) and the engine (in this case, 'sql') for executing the code chunk. However, R Markdown does not support 'sql' as an engine natively. The supported engines in R Markdown are typically R, Python, Bash, and other programming languages. If you specify 'sql' as the engine, it may cause an error as it is not recognized. 

### Step 2. Design a Normalized schema

Each table should contain columns that are only relevant to the primary key.  So, lets categorize columns and split it creating separate tables for each category. The image bellow is the initial schema for data normalization:
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="schema1.png" alt="Image Alt Text" style="max-width: 100% height: auto;">
</div>

#### Creating the table player_info

```{r}
# Creates the table

player_table <- 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS player (player_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,

                                      last_name TEXT);'
dbExecute(conn, player_table)

# Inserts values from person_codes
insert <- 'INSERT OR IGNORE INTO player
  SELECT first AS first_name,
         last AS last_name,
         id AS player_id
